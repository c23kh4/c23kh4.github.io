<h1>Umbra Explained</h1>
<p>The main structure of Umbra relies on a group of variables (one for each path/storyline) that are set to "false" or "true".</p>
<center><div id="div2"></div>
	<p>All variables are set to false at the beginning of the game. When a player finishes a path- in the one pictured below, access to the last scene requires input of a passwordâ€”they are taken to a new page, which sets the variable for their path to true.</p>
<div id="div3"></div>
<p>I used an if statement requiring all variables to be true to get through the door to the final storyline.</p>
<div id="div1"></div></center>
<p>You can do a ton of other things with variables and gates in Twine. For example: you can randomize which passage a link takes the reader by modifying your brackets. "The time machine launches into the [[glowing vortex|either("12000 BC","The Future","2AM Yesterday")]]."" Something else you can do with passages and links: change the content of a passage based on how many times a player has visited it. There's a ton of interesting stuff online about other built in functions of Twine.</p>
<p><b>To be continued: I might post answers to Umbra here sometime in the future. </b></p>
