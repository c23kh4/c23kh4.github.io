	<a href="spins.html">First Codesketch!</a>
	This was really random. Just messed around with some CSS effects and arrays in javascript.

<p>
It's October and Halloween is where it's at. I've started brainstorming my storyboard for an interactive story idea inspired by The Addams Family and ravens and other October-y things. It will feature sparse artwork, which I'm hoping to use as transition links and animations.

<p>This is a mockup for the room we were brainstorming. I was thinking about spaceships, apparently. All spaceships should have at least one disco ball. </p>

<p><a href="experiment.html">Traffic light code ditty</a></p>
<p> This is a quick, fun code ditty I put together using the gists for event listeners and positioning elements on the screen. I think next week I may come back to it and add some other elements to make it more complicated, like a car that you can move around with your arrow keys. I'm interested in learning more about coding for games. I'm pretty happy with this sketch, and excited to incorporate event listeners into my other projects (like the one I mentioned in my last entry—that will be happening soon). </p>
<h2> Entry 5: October 28, 2019</h2>
<p>I'm archiving the October project for now to start on an octopus story for the kindergardeners. I'm going to begin by reading the book <i>The Soul of An Octopus</i> and then write a story through Twine, a new story-writing program I was just introduced to. The Octopus will be named Umbra and it will be devious. I'm planning for the user to decide what the octopus should do out of the variety of options in the ocean. The good stuff will be philosophical: What does it <i>mean</i> to be an octopus? </p>
<h2> Entry 6: November 5, 2019</h2>
<p> I've officially started writing the octopus story on Twine! I've decided to incorporate javacript by using some sort of passcode to protect the ending of the story. The user will need to collect clues from the rest of story in order to progress to the end.</p> 
<div id="twinepic"></div>
<p>Twine is an interesting tool to use because of the way it allows you to visualise your project in linear (or not-so-linear) form... There is a downside in that it takes some time to figure out how CSS and java are used in twine. I'm not satisfied yet with the style of my story because it's taking some time to figure out how to manipulate the program.</p>
<p>Now that I've laid out the storyline, I plan to learn more about CSS and java in twine and incorporate it into my story. I also plan to develop the plot and add images (I haven't decided whether to draw those or use images from the web). </p>
<h2>Entry 7: November 12, 2019</h2>
<p>Today in class we worked on writing a program that would count from 1 to 100 but and replace some of the numbers with the words "fizz," "buzz," and "fizzbuzz." OUr logic looked like this:
<li>Define variable "counter"</li> 
<li>if counter is divisible by neither three or five, say counter. If divisible by three but not five say fizz. If divisible by five but not three, say buzz. If divisible by both, say fizzbuzz.</li> 
<li>Add 1 to variable counter and repeat. </li> 

We encountered some trouble with how to find the remainder once counter was divided by three or five. On scratch, eventually we found mod, a helpful tool which allowed us to reference the event where there was no remainder after the division. We then stuck all of our code inside a loop which repeats until 100 is reached. </p>
<div id="fizzbuzz"></div>
<h2>Entry 8: November 18, 2019</h2>
<p><a href="redblue.html">red-blue codesketch</a>This week I experimented with javascript functions. I decided I wanted the color of my screen to change based on the position of the mouse; this required an event listener for "mousemove" which logged the x coordinate of the mouse. Utimately, I want this number to be part of an rgb value so that the background color can constantly change. For now, though, I decided to use an if statement. If the x value of the mouse is greater than a certain number, the screen turns blue, and the inner text of the divs changes.   </p>
<h2>Entry 9: December 1, 2019</h2>
<p>Codesketches update! <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/344145972">link to fizzbuzz on scratch</a> I've linked to the fizzbuzz scratch project I mentioned last month, but I'll embed it here to because I just learned how to do that. <iframe src="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/344145972/embed" allowtransparency="true" width="485" height="402" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p>I've also updated the Redblue codesketch from last month to include a function. Hooray! <a href="redblue.html">red-blue update</a> Should I call it red-blue-green now? Haha. This update was harder than it looks because I ended up making an aditional div which changed color along with the rest of the background. If statements are wild. </p>
<a href="array.html"></a> Here's yet another codesketch! This one experiments with arrays, like the "spins" one I did at the beginning of the year. It was also a foray into random color generators.
	<h2>Entry 10: January 6, 2020</h2>
	<p><a href="Umbra.html">Click here!</a>
		THE PROJECT IS UP. I'm super happy with it. (though I'm worried the puzzles are too hard... I'm going to post answers on here soon.) Because I wanted some local files to be background images, I had to export it from twine and then go in with sublime text and mess with some things. This version is kind of rough, so I may update it at some point. </p>
		<h2>Entry 11: January 30, 2020</h2>
		<p> <a href="loona.html">Swarming divs</a>
			In honor of Loona's upcoming comeback (STAN LOONA YOU COWARDS) I dedicated this week's project to them. I used a function to make a bunch of divs and an array to assign them all different background images. Math.random was a super useful tool for randomizing numbers like height, position, and rotation. Because this is a magic trick, clicking on the button changes its style so that it covers the entire page, making the divs "disappear". This was kind of a lame solution, so in the future I want to go back in and do the same thing in a better way. One way to do that might be to remove the class of the divs.
		</p>
		<h2>Entry 12: February 4, 2020</h2>
		<p>The "Eating animals" codesketch appears to have three divs with text and four with images. One of the image divs (the plate) has javascript which changes its background image on click. The two circle divs on the sides are probably linked to an if statement, ie if div1 = steak then div2 backgroud image = cow and div3 background image = cow. </p>
		<p>I need to catch up on some work, so here's some coding gift ideas:
			<li>A project for my dad's birthday this week that visualises every Yankee game we've been to and the score at each. I could use different colored dots for wins/losses and hovering over one would display more information. Possible background:Yankee stadium. Maybe dots go where we were sitting?</li>
			<li>It's Natalie's birthday in two weeks. I could make her an online collage with all of the weird stuff she likes lmao. The images would be links to youtube videos and the like. Maybe I could even make it a bulletin board type of thing? So that anyone could put something up so another visitor of the page could view it.</li>
			<li>Gift for George:a website that displays all the religions we've  created over the years (Blakism, the cult of Bakuki, automaton, etc.) </li>
			<li></li>
			</p>
			<h2>Entry 13: February 14, 2020</h2>
			<p>Against my better judgement I have made a Valentine's day card for Natalie. We were both going to use knives but that was vetoed so now there are ducks. I reused a lot of the code from my swarming divs codesketch. <a href="card.html">Card</a></p>
			<h2>Entry 13: February 21, 2020</h2>
			<p>Everyone is playing Umbra. I'm not sure why but I'm happy people like it. I've been working on an update with new storylines! This week, I'm trying to think of new project ideas for second semester. Here's a list:
			<li>Another story-type thing because I really liked writing Umbra. The emphasis would be more on the story than the game, and I probable (?) wouldn't do it in Twine because I'm sick of it.</li>
			<li>An eating-animals type of thing. The only problem is that I can't think of any ideas for that format that would interest me. I'm linking a prototype for that format filled with nonsense because I didn't know what to put in it. <a href="connect.html"></li>
			<p>Brainstorm: what things do I like to make stuff about? <p>
				<li>I could do a variation on the eating-animals code but with softball situation. The screen will display a picture of the basepaths with runners on, the outs, the score, the inning. The left text box will describe the hit and the right defense, and the right will have reasoning for what all the base runners need to do. I could even code in a menu so that the user could change the situation: ie click runners on and off the bases and toggle the outs.</li> </p>
				<h2>Entry 14: March 6, 2020</h2>
				<p><a href="umbraexp.html">Today I pushed an Umbra explanation that talks about the code and puzzles and stuff. Still thinking about my project. Details to come. I've done some work on Umbra—added new storylines– but I'm not sure I'll push it because I like it the way it is. Natalie and I could do a story collab (I would write, she would draw). </p>
