	This was really random. Just messed around with some CSS effects and arrays in javascript.

<p>
It's October and Halloween is where it's at. I've started brainstorming my storyboard for an interactive story idea inspired by The Addams Family and ravens and other October-y things. It will feature sparse artwork, which I'm hoping to use as transition links and animations.

<p><a href="spins.html">Room mockup</a></p>
<p>This is a mockup for the room we were brainstorming. I was thinking about spaceships, apparently. All spaceships should have at least one disco ball. </p>

<p><a href="experiment.html">Traffic light code ditty</a></p>
<p> This is a quick, fun code ditty I put together using the gists for event listeners and positioning elements on the screen. I think next week I may come back to it and add some other elements to make it more complicated, like a car that you can move around with your arrow keys. I'm interested in learning more about coding for games. I'm pretty happy with this sketch, and excited to incorporate event listeners into my other projects (like the one I mentioned in my last entryâ€”that will be happening soon). </p>
<h2> Entry 5: October 28, 2019</h2>
<p>I'm archiving the October project for now to start on an octopus story for the kindergardeners. I'm going to begin by reading the book <i>The Soul of An Octopus</i> and then write a story through Twine, a new story-writing program I was just introduced to. The Octopus will be named Umbra and it will be devious. I'm planning for the user to decide what the octopus should do out of the variety of options in the ocean. The good stuff will be philosophical: What does it <i>mean</i> to be an octopus? </p>
<h2> Entry 6: November 5, 2019</h2>
<p> I've officially started writing the octopus story on Twine! I've decided to incorporate javacript by using some sort of passcode to protect the ending of the story. The user will need to collect clues from the rest of story in order to progress to the end.</p> 
<div id="twinepic"></div>
<p>Twine is an interesting tool to use because of the way it allows you to visualise your project in linear (or not-so-linear) form... There is a downside in that it takes some time to figure out how CSS and java are used in twine. I'm not satisfied yet with the style of my story because it's taking some time to figure out how to manipulate the program.</p>
<p>Now that I've laid out the storyline, I plan to learn more about CSS and java in twine and incorporate it into my story. I also plan to develop the plot and add images (I haven't decided whether to draw those or use images from the web). </p>
