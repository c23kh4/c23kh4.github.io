	This was really random. Just messed around with some CSS effects and arrays in javascript.

<p>
It's October and Halloween is where it's at. I've started brainstorming my storyboard for an interactive story idea inspired by The Addams Family and ravens and other October-y things. It will feature sparse artwork, which I'm hoping to use as transition links and animations.

<p>This is a mockup for the room we were brainstorming. I was thinking about spaceships, apparently. All spaceships should have at least one disco ball. </p>

<p><a href="experiment.html">Traffic light code ditty</a></p>
<p> This is a quick, fun code ditty I put together using the gists for event listeners and positioning elements on the screen. I think next week I may come back to it and add some other elements to make it more complicated, like a car that you can move around with your arrow keys. I'm interested in learning more about coding for games. I'm pretty happy with this sketch, and excited to incorporate event listeners into my other projects (like the one I mentioned in my last entryâ€”that will be happening soon). </p>
